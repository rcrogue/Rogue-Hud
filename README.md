# Rogue-Hud

STILL VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS

My first ever hud, it was not as terrible as I thought it was but it did involve a lot of code. Luckily after you learn the basics, it is just a grind to finish the rest.
***So far all I have done is the basic position of the health, ammo, medic charge, and some weapon charges.***
I will work on the vaccinator later, but for now it is broken due to Valve and their terrible coding for it.
Thanks to all of those who supported me in my youtube channel and also the making of this hud of course. Was fun
